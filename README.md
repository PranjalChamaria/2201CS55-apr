Binary classification on the Adult Census Income dataset using:

Logistic Regression (full data) → 85% accuracy (best C=0.1, L2).

SVM (subset 10k, linear kernel) → 85% accuracy (best C=0.1).

Both models perform similarly; Logistic Regression is faster and more interpretable.
Confusion matrices and ROC curves are included in the notebook.
